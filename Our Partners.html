    Company History:<br>
    </p>
    <p class="InTheMiddleSmall">
  - Oxey was founded in the USA by Svaloknok K. in 1957. In the same year, we opened our first factory making pharmaceutical equidment at first.<br>
    - In 1962, after 5, despite having high profits, the company faces heavy financial troubles because of being forced to buy resources for a high prices. For this, the company shifts its interest and makes the decision to start making military issue equipment for NATO.<br>
    -Our company participates in several wars in the upcoming years. However, for security reasons, we have to conceal this information about which wars these were.<br>
    -The company acquired several factories in the upcoming years in these countries: Brazilian State, State of Bolivia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, French Algeria, Republic of South Africa, United States of Oceania (This mainly means the old country called "New Zealand").<br>
    -The company reaches its first golden age as it gets several contracts by the NATO countries.<br>
    -However, after the crisis of the 70's, our company once again faces financial issues and must expand to survive. For this, our company has begun a combined development with several other companies to develop a new technology to face the Eastern Continent.<br>
    -This came to fruition in 1996, as the creation of biomechanical augmentation creates a new age for humanity. This year marks the start of First Generation Augmentations.<br>
    -With this new-found golden age, our company began expanding, building factories across all NATO member countries.<br>
    -2005 marks the year of the beginning of Star Wars where the NATO and ECA race towards space dominance.<br>
    - 2006 marks the Second Generation of Augmentation with smaller, more useful, compact products.<br>
    -2016 marks the Third generation of Augmentation. From here on, our company begun selling first generation and second generation products to the civilian populace<br>
