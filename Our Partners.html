    Company History:<br>
    </p>
    <p class="InTheMiddleSmall">
    - Oxey is founded in the USA, by Svaloknok K. in 1957. In the same year we open our first factory making first pharmaceutical equidment.<br>
    - In 1962 after 5 despite having high profits the company still faces heavy financial troubles for being forced to buy resources for a high prices. For this the company shifts its interest and makes the decision to start making military issue equidment for the NATO.<br>
    -Our company participates in several wars in the upcoming years however for security reasons we have to conceal this information on which wars were these.<br>
    -The company acquires several companies in these countries: Brazilian State,State of Bolivia,Democratic Republic of the Congo,
    French Algeria,Republic of South Africa,United States of Oceania (This mainly means the old country called "New Zealand")<br>
    -The company reaches its first golden age as it gets several contracts by the NATO countries.<br>
    -However after the crisis of the 70's our company once again faces financial issues and must expand to survive. For this our company starts development with several other companies for developing a new technology to face the Eastern Continent.<br>
    -This came to fruition as along with the several other companies we have created biomechanical augmentation. From this year we consider First Generation Augmentations.<br>
